flask-RESTful
=============

Installation
------------
(we don't need to manually specify flask as it is a dependency of flask-RESTful)
(we're assuming that we'll be using peewee as our ORM)
```console
(venv) $ pip3 install flask-restful peewee
```

Usage
-----
See [Treehouse/.../flask-restful](https://github.com/Crossroadsman/Treehouse/tree/master/Tracks/Flask/flask-restful) for a demo project.
